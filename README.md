# Free and Open Education Project (FOEP)

From beginner to never end.

## Description

This work-in-progress (WIP) project aims to provide free and open source education to the world. The project exists primarily as a course of courses to cover several fields and topics. Today, education and knowledge are expensive, proprietary, or low in quality. The Free and Open Education Project (FOEP) voluntarily devotes time to organize existing educational information and knowledge into a platform that everyone is able to use and improve. Our project holds no biases against any field or discipline as long as the information is publicly accepted or formally verified. We do not condone false information or manipulation of sources.
